# RBLX-Open-Exploit
Open source exploit GUI with WRD API.

**NOTE:** 
Technically open source, but the API itself is not, so i'm not responsible for anything happens if you got any viruses or etc because i only provided you the GUI for making it easier to use WRD API.

## Installation
Just simply go to [Releases](https://github.com/Kirima2nd/RBLX-Open-Exploit/releases) page to download a copy.

## Contributing
When contributing the source code, please refrain from making it complicated and keep it simple since it's open source project.

Also, do not make unnecessary commit that is unrelated to the GUI. Thank you ^^
